# Overview

Welcome to my **JSON Converter**! This is a simple application that allows you to translate a JSON response into a Data Model (a set of classes) in your
desired programming language. Using this model, the user can quickly produce usable JSON models in their desired language, allowing them to call members of
the JSON response as member variables of a parent object.

# Development Environment

The base "engine" of this program is built using C# and the JSON Nodes library. To make this program more user-friendly, I added a UI built in WinUI 3. For ease
of development, this program was built originally in JetBrains Rider, then in Visual Studio for WinUI 3 development.
